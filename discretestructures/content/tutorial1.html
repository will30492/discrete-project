<h2>Introduction to Graphs</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to the world of graph theory! In this tutorial, we'll explore the
  basics of graphs, including key definitions and fundamental concepts.
</p>

<h3>What is a Graph?</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>graph</strong> is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise
  relations between objects. It consists of two sets:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Vertices (or Nodes)</strong>: The fundamental units or points.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edges (or Links)</strong>: The connections between the vertices.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Formally, a graph is denoted as \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V \) is a set of
  vertices, and \( E \) is a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices.
</p>

<h3>Key Definitions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Adjacent Vertices</strong>: Two vertices are adjacent if they are
    connected by an edge.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Degree of a Vertex</strong>: The number of edges incident to a
    vertex.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Path</strong>: A sequence of edges that connects a sequence of
    vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cycle</strong>: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex
    without repeating any edges or vertices (except the starting/ending vertex).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Graph</h3>

<p>Consider the following graph:</p>

<img src="assets/graph_example1.png" alt="Example Graph" />

<p>In this graph:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vertices: \( V = \{a, b, c, d, e\} \)</li>
  <li>Edges: \( E = \{\{a, b\}, \{a, d\}, \{b, c\}, \{c, d\}, \{a, e\}\} \)</li>
  <li>The degree of vertex \( a \) is 3.</li>
  <li>Vertices \( b \) and \( c \) are adjacent.</li>
  <li>Vertex \( e \) is an isolated connection, only linked to \( a \).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applications of Graphs</h3>

<p>Graphs are used in various fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Computer Networks</strong>: Modeling connections between computers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Social Networks</strong>: Representing relationships between people.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transportation</strong>: Mapping routes and networks.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Biology</strong>: Analyzing neural networks or ecological
    relationships.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Interactive Example</h3>

<p>
  Let's visualize a simple graph. Click the button below to create and display
  it.

<h3>Practice Exercise</h3>

<p>Try to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The degree of each vertex in the graph.</li>
  <li>All possible paths from vertex A to vertex D.</li>
  <li>If there are any cycles in the graph.</li>
</ul>
