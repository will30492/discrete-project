<h2>Eulerian and Hamiltonian Paths</h2>

<p>
  Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths are specific types of paths in a graph,
  significant in various applications.
</p>

<h3>Eulerian Paths and Circuits</h3>

<p>
  An <strong>Eulerian path</strong> is a path that visits every edge exactly
  once. An <strong>Eulerian circuit</strong> is an Eulerian path that starts and
  ends at the same vertex.
</p>

<h4>Conditions for Existence</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    An undirected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if all vertices have
    even degrees.
  </li>
  <li>
    An undirected graph has an Eulerian path (but not a circuit) if exactly two
    vertices have odd degrees.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>Hamiltonian path</strong> is a path that visits every vertex exactly
  once. A <strong>Hamiltonian cycle</strong> is a Hamiltonian path that starts
  and ends at the same vertex.
</p>

<p>
  Determining whether such paths exist is generally NP-complete, making it
  computationally challenging.
</p>
