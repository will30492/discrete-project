<h2>Advanced Topics in Graph Theory</h2>

<p>
  In this tutorial, we'll briefly introduce some advanced topics in graph
  theory.
</p>

<h3>Network Flows</h3>

<p>
  Network flow problems involve finding the optimal way to route flow through a
  network, such as maximizing the flow from a source to a sink.
</p>

<h4>Ford-Fulkerson Method</h4>

<p>An algorithm to compute the maximum flow in a flow network.</p>

<h3>Matching Theory</h3>

<p>
  A matching in a graph is a set of edges without common vertices. In bipartite
  graphs, matchings are used in assignment problems.
</p>

<h4>Hungarian Algorithm</h4>

<p>Solves the assignment problem in polynomial time.</p>

<h3>Spectral Graph Theory</h3>

<p>
  Studies properties of a graph in relation to the characteristics of its
  adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix.
</p>

<p>Applications include clustering, ranking, and network analysis.</p>
