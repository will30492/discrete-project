<h2>Types of Graphs</h2>

<p>
  Graphs can be classified based on their characteristics. Understanding these
  types helps in choosing the right algorithms and models for different
  problems.

<h3>Undirected vs. Directed Graphs</h3>

<h4>Undirected Graphs</h4>

<p>
  In an <strong>undirected graph</strong>, edges have no orientation. The edge
  between vertices \( u \) and \( v \) is represented as \( \{u, v\} \), and it
  implies a two-way relationship.
</p>

<h4>Directed Graphs (Digraphs)</h4>

<p>
  In a <strong>directed graph</strong>, edges have a direction, represented as
  ordered pairs \( (u, v) \). This indicates a one-way relationship from \( u \)
  to \( v \).
</p>

<h3>Weighted Graphs</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>weighted graph</strong> assigns a numerical value, or weight, to
  each edge. Weights can represent distances, costs, capacities, or other
  quantities.

<h3>Special Graphs</h3>

<h4>Bipartite Graphs</h4>

<p>
  A <strong>bipartite graph</strong> has its vertices divided into two disjoint
  sets \( U \) and \( V \) such that every edge connects a vertex in \( U \) to
  one in \( V \). There are no edges between vertices within the same set.
</p>

<h4>Complete Graphs</h4>

<p>
  A <strong>complete graph</strong>, denoted as \( K_n \), is an undirected
  graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.
