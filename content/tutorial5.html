<h2>Shortest Path Algorithms</h2>

<p>
  Finding the shortest path between nodes is a common problem. Algorithms like
  Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford solve this for different types of graphs.
</p>

<h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>

<p>
  Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a single source vertex to
  all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm Steps</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Set the distance to the source node to zero and all other nodes to infinity.
  </li>
  <li>Mark all nodes unvisited. Set the source node as current.</li>
  <li>
    For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate
    their tentative distances.
  </li>
  <li>
    When done with current node, mark it as visited. A visited node will not be
    checked again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new
    current node.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat steps 3-5 until all nodes are visited.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Interactive Dijkstra's Algorithm</h4>

<p>Click the button to run Dijkstra's algorithm on a sample graph.</p>

<script>
  document.getElementById("run-dijkstra").addEventListener("click", () => {
    // Initialize weighted graph
    // Implement Dijkstra's algorithm with visual steps
  });
</script>

<h3>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h3>

<p>
  Bellman-Ford algorithm computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to
  all other vertices in a weighted digraph, even if some edge weights are
  negative.
</p>

<p>It can detect negative cycles and report their existence.</p>

<h4>Algorithm Steps</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Initialize the distance to the source to zero and all others to infinity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Relax all edges \( |V| - 1 \) times:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        For each edge \( (u, v) \), if \( distance[u] + weight(u, v) <
        distance[v] \), update \( distance[v] \).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Check for negative-weight cycles:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>If a further relaxation is possible, a negative cycle exists.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Practice Exercise</h3>

  from vertex A to all other vertices.
